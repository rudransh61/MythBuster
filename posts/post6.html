                            <h1>A small message to my Indian brother sisters - Rudransh</h1>

                            Science , The most powerful tool made by humanity to understand the universe , 
                            The people who use this weapons are called scientists . Many people say that this is closely
                            related to maths (which is another tool). But it was not a work of single bladesmith ,
                            Many different and brilliant people across the world had worked on this weapon to make it stronger
                            , Many of them had same idea to improve it , BUT we don't say that they copied it , or we should ?
                            <br>
                            The hardest part was the forging in beginning , with no idea how the sword will look like 
                            Our great scientists and mathematicians worked on it  .
                            <br> 
                            Many of the initial forging was done by the civilizations of that time , like harappa , mesopotamia , babylonians and .....
                            <br>
                            And further work was done by next generation of scientists ...
                            like Aryabhatt , Bharkaracharya , Bhaudayana , Pythagorus , Nichomachus , Fibonacci , Euclid , Diophantus , Thales , Brahmagupta , Kanada , Pingala , Archimedes , Liu , Al-Jabr , Al-Khwarizmi , Thabit  , Khayyam , Madhava , and more.......... 
                            
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Many of the initial development was done by Indians , Greeks , Chinese , And Persians.... 
                            <br>
                            Many other mathematicians and scientists like Newton, Ramanuja , Leibniz , Bernoulli shaped the tip of sword ..... 
                            <br>
                            And we all thank to the great people who started this development all over the world . 
                            
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <i>"Perhaps, posterity will thank me for having shown that the ancients did not know everything."-Pierre de Fermat</i>

                             <br>
                             <br>
                             <br>
                             <br>
                             But many so called 'indians' claims , that many things should be named after indians.
                             They claims that most of the development was done here and they have right to demand this . 
                             <br>
                             For these arguments , I want to say that these development was not done alone , they were collaboration of different ideas and improvements . 
                             Instead of doing this for some proud moment of my country , we should work ahead , not for your country , for humanity . 
                             <br>
                             Yes , they have right to claim that , but its too late , now we should forget the past and work for development . 
                             If you want to make your country feel proud , it should not be like "Now We will study Bhadayana discovered Gravity not Newton" , it should be like 
                             "Finally , one of the most crucial problem for mathematics has been solved ... , Lets analyze it further " .
