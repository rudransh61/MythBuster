                            Taj Mahal & Shah Jahan
                            <hr>
                            Points to prove the statement "Shah Jahan mutilated those who built the Taj Mahal" wrong:
                            Lack of historical evidence:
                            <hr>
                            No contemporary accounts, chronicles, or official documents from the Mughal period mention
                            any such mutilation. The story first appears in Western publications in the 19th century and
                            gains traction much later.
                            The meticulous detail of Mughal court records wouldn't have missed such a drastic and cruel
                            act.
                            <hr>
                            Architectural manuals from the era discuss labor practices and craftsmanship, but none
                            mention mutilation.
                            Logistical improbability:
                            <hr>
                            Mutilating skilled artisans would be counterproductive and impede the project's completion.
                            The Taj Mahal's exquisite design and execution required the expertise of these very workers.
                            Replacing thousands of skilled laborers would be extremely difficult and delay the project
                            significantly.
                            The myth contradicts Shah Jahan's reputation as a patron of the arts and architecture. He
                            was known for his respect for skilled artisans and artists.
                            Alternative explanations for the myth's origin:
                            <hr>
                            The story might be a misinterpretation of the practice of branding slaves to prevent escape.
                            However, historical records suggest minimal slave labor was used in the Taj Mahal's
                            construction.
                            It could be a romanticized exaggeration of the harsh working conditions and exploitation
                            prevalent during large construction projects back then. This statement might also be used by
                            historians or writers to exaggerate but it was falsely considered true later on.
                            Evidence of fair treatment of workers:
                            <hr>
                            Mughal chronicles mention incentives and rewards given to workers, including land grants and
                            bonuses.
                            The presence of worker settlements near the Taj Mahal suggests they weren't confined or
                            mistreated.
                            Records indicate the employment of a diverse workforce drawn from various regions and
                            religions, further undermining the narrative of widespread cruelty.
