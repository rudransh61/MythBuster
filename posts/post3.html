Debunking the Myth: We Use 10% of Our Brain
The idea that we only use 10% of our brain is a persistent and deeply ingrained myth. But science paints a very different picture! Here are some key points to refute this misconception:

1. Evidence from Brain Imaging:

FMRI scans: These images show that even simple tasks activate almost the entire brain. Different areas light up depending on the specific function being performed.
PET scans: They track blood flow in the brain, further demonstrating widespread activity during various mental processes.
2. Consequences of Brain Damage:

Damage to any part of the brain often leads to specific cognitive impairments, suggesting all areas play a crucial role in overall function.
Even seemingly "dormant" areas exhibit activity during sleep and rest, indicating they participate in essential background processes.
