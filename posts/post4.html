                                <u>Disclaimer</u> : This post is not made for disrespecting any mathematician or any contribution or any politicians , In maths every contribution counts, and we respect all religious and traditional culture and all the preserved texts. All these information for taken from facts and references .

                            </p>

                            There are many so called 'historians' and 'mathematicians' who claims that 'India invented almost everything in human history'.
                            <br>These so called "intellectuals" students publish their thesis through social media, And thought they will
                            <br>change the 'western is education system' ... and so ...
                            <br>And I don't know why people think these so called "intellectuals" are correct and our scientists are wrong .
                            <br>These so called 'desh bhakt' defame scientist for nationalism and religious purpose .
                            <br>After Independence , Our country should grow in field of technology , engineering , sciences and labs etc.
                            <br>And should respect all countries and 'behave' like a independent country .
                            <br>But some propaganda people wants to feed us Indians with a sense of supremacy.They forget that there is thin line between truth and fiction.
                            <br>They dont want to grow , they want to claim that these are their works (stolen from Ancient India).
    <br>
                            A lot of people believe that Vedas are the ultimate truth . I m not saying Vedas are useless but 
                            <br> They are not complete truth , In compared to our modern science , Vedas knowledge is only a sand particle . <br>

                            <br>
                            And these so called people sell Vedas as :
                            <br> They knew about cosmos, big bang (even though they didn't know about planetary model and the existence of the continent of Australia' right here on earth.) , they knew about plastic surgery (even though they didn't know about germ theory and physiology) <br>
                            , They knew about all laws of physics : gravity, strong force, electromagnetism (yet could not use them to develop technology anywhere close to what we have now)


                            <br>
                            Then what ?? Of course, magically all of this knowledge got lost or the west stole it.

                            <br>
                            Even many politicians made very silly statements like these claims.
                            <br>
                            There is no doubt that these ancient books contained some science comparable to that of other contemporary civilizations. 

                            <br>
                            Some reasons why people thought 'India is the center of the world'

                            <ul>

                                <li>Lack of critical thinking ...= Sadly , in our glorious country our people believes in these people without even thinking about these statements . <br> "They thought It is feelin good , so it is right !! Yeah What a Critical Thinker I am"</li>
                                <li> History .... = Because of our colonial history , people hates westerns , idk why , they think they stole it from us during colonial period . And Because of this they cannot accept the reality ,
                                <br> that whether India had great mathematical history or not , west 'is' dominating in science</li>

                                <br>
                            </ul>
                                Lets Look at some actual Contribution of ancient India .
                               <ul>


                                    <li>Invention of Zero : Decimal was invented in India , used in modern maths also . It was later transmitted to other countries through traders.</li>

                                    <li>Trigonometry : Trigonometry was invented in India from a bow and an arrow with all functions (sine,cosine,tangent,cotangent,cosecant,secant)               </li>

                                    <li>Algebra : Solving polynomials and algebraic expressions      </li>

                                    <li> And more..... </li>


                               </ul>

                               <ul>


                               </ul>

                                Ancient India was very good at astronomy at that time compared to other civilizations.
                                <ul>
                                    <li> Jyotishas : Indian scripts like Jyotishas tells us how their calendar works , and how they studied planetary motions .  </li>

                                </ul>
                            
                            Not only India , other civilizations were also very good at science like, egyptians invented pythagoras theorem , chinese were good at medicines , also greek were good at maths , persians worked on combinatorics and maths ,.... and more.

                            <br>
                            India was not the only civilization to discover something called maths .
                            <br>
                            To learn in depth about ancient India science and techniques , I will highly recommend a very good <br> book
                            <a href="https://avadicrpf.kvs.ac.in/sites/default/files/582171867vvm.pdf">"Indian Contributions to Science - Vijnana Bharti"</a>.



                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Also , Instead of these fake claims , We should now work more in sciences , and appreciate every contribution from every where. We should forget our past and should write our future ourself , because none of the claims will make INDIA a better country .
                            <br>

                            <ul>

                                <li> Plastic roads - In 2006, Dr R Vasudevan patented a road-laying process that involves sprinkling shredded plastic waste over hot gravel, coating the stones in a thin film of plastic, and then adding the plastic-coated stones to regular molten tar and laying the road. </li>

                                <li>  Paper microscope - Manu Prakash, a scientist at Stanford University created a paper microscope called the Foldscope. It can be printed on a single sheet of paper and folded into shape and used.  </li>
                                <li>   Bottle Cap Filter - The guy name Niranjan Karagi, in what we call an underappreciated invention, he used nano-composite technology to create a small bottle cap filter that cleans contaminated water 99.9%. </li>
